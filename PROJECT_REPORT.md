3. **Create a seamless user experience** that integrates multiple authentication modalities
4. **Demonstrate real-world applicability** of multimodal biometric systems

## 🔧 **Technical Approach**

### **1. Data Preprocessing and Integration**

#### **Data Sources:**
- **Customer Social Profiles** (`customer_social_profiles.xlsx`): Social media engagement, purchase interest scores, sentiment analysis
- **Customer Transactions** (`customer_transactions.xlsx`): Purchase history, product categories, customer ratings
- **Facial Images** (`Images/`): Multiple expressions per user (neutral, smiling, surprised)
- **Voice Samples** (`Audio/`): Confirmation and approval voice recordings

#### **Data Merging Strategy:**
```python
# Merge customer data based on ID mapping
merged_data = pd.merge(social_profiles, transactions, 
                      left_on='customer_id_new', 
                      right_on='customer_id_legacy', 
                      how='inner')
```

### **2. Facial Recognition System**

#### **Feature Extraction:**
- **Color Histogram Features**: RGB channel histograms normalized to 32 bins per channel
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: Edge and texture features using Sobel filters
- **Feature Vector**: 40-dimensional feature space combining color and texture information

#### **Implementation:**
```python
def extract_image_features(image_path):
    # Color histogram extraction
    hist_features = []
    for i in range(3):
        hist = cv2.calcHist([img_rgb], [i], None, [32], [0, 256])
        hist_features.extend(cv2.normalize(hist, hist).flatten())
    
    # HOG-like features using Sobel operators
    gx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_32F, 1, 0)
    gy = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_32F, 0, 1)
    mag, ang = cv2.cartToPolar(gx, gy)
    hog_features = np.concatenate([mag.flatten()[:20], ang.flatten()[:20]])
    
    return np.concatenate([hist_features, hog_features])
```

### **3. Voice Verification System**

#### **Audio Feature Extraction:**
- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**: 13 coefficients with mean and standard deviation
- **Spectral Features**: Spectral rolloff and centroid for frequency characteristics
- **Temporal Features**: Zero-crossing rate and RMS energy
- **Feature Vector**: 30-dimensional feature space

#### **Implementation:**
```python
def extract_audio_features(audio_path):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=None)
    
    # MFCC features
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
    mfccs_mean = np.mean(mfccs, axis=1)
    mfccs_std = np.std(mfccs, axis=1)
    
    # Spectral features
    rolloff_mean = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff(y=y, sr=sr))
    centroid_mean = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr))
    
    # Temporal features
    zcr_mean = np.mean(librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y))
    rms_mean = np.mean(librosa.feature.rms(y=y))
    
    return np.concatenate([mfccs_mean, mfccs_std, 
                          [rolloff_mean, centroid_mean, zcr_mean, rms_mean]])
```

### **4. Machine Learning Models**

#### **Classification Models:**
- **Face Recognition**: Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators
- **Voice Verification**: Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators
- **Product Recommendation**: Random Forest Classifier for category prediction

#### **Model Training:**
```python
# Face recognition model
face_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
face_model.fit(image_features, image_labels)

# Voice verification model
voice_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
voice_model.fit(audio_features, audio_labels)

# Product recommendation model
product_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
product_model.fit(customer_features, product_categories)
```

### **5. System Architecture**

#### **Authentication Flow:**
1. **Access Request**: User attempts to access the product prediction model
2. **Face Recognition**: System processes facial image and verifies identity (confidence > 0.6)
3. **Model Access**: If face is recognized, user gains access to prediction functionality
4. **Voice Confirmation**: Prediction must be confirmed through voice verification (confidence > 0.7)
5. **Identity Matching**: System ensures face and voice belong to the same user
6. **Prediction Execution**: If all checks pass, personalized recommendation is provided

---

## 📊 **System Performance**

### **Security Metrics:**
- **Face Recognition Threshold**: 60% confidence minimum
- **Voice Verification Threshold**: 70% confidence minimum
- **Identity Matching**: Strict requirement for face-voice identity consistency

### **Model Accuracy:**
- **Face Recognition**: Trained on 9 images (3 users × 3 expressions)
- **Voice Verification**: Trained on 12 audio samples (3 users × 4 samples)
- **Product Recommendation**: Based on engagement score, purchase interest, and customer rating

## 🎬 **System Demonstration**

### **Scenario 1: Successful Authentication**
- **Input**: Valid face image + matching voice sample
- **Output**: ✅ Access granted → Prediction generated → Voice confirmed → Recommendation provided

### **Scenario 2: Access Denied**
- **Input**: Unrecognized face image
- **Output**: ❌ Access denied → No prediction access

### **Scenario 3: Voice Verification Failed**
- **Input**: Valid face + mismatched voice
- **Output**: ✅ Access granted → ❌ Voice verification failed → Prediction blocked
